How to run the application:
To run the application a user will need an IDE that is capable of running a .NET framework MVC.
For this REAMDE I will provide the link to doanload visual studio which will allow you to run this application

# Visual Studio website link:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
Remember to choose the community option unless you wish to pay for the IDE.

Once the IDE has been downloaded and installed there are three option to retrieve this code: download a zip file, clone the repository or open it with visual studio.

Option A:
To download a zip folder of this code, simply locate the gree code button, click on it and at the bottom of the box will be the option to download the zip folder.

Option B:
In the same box as the zip folder download, a link will appear this link is used within visual studio. This method will require the user to navigate to the git tab at the top and in the dropdown will appear the words "clone repository" click that and paste the link from GitHub in it to clone the repo.

Option C: 
In the same box where we download the zip file, above that is the option to open in visual studio.
